# Synapse Testing Strategy

## Overview
This document outlines the testing strategy for the Synapse project, including test types, coverage requirements, and best practices.

## Test Types

### Unit Tests
Located in `src/tests/unit/`
- Isolated tests for individual components
- Mock external dependencies
- Fast execution
- High coverage requirement (>90%)

Current unit test suites:
1. Message Service (`test_message_service.py`)
   - CRUD operations
   - Validation
   - Error handling
   - Pagination
   - 100% coverage

2. Cache Service (`test_cache_service.py`)
   - Redis operations
   - JSON serialization
   - TTL handling
   - Error scenarios
   - 100% coverage

### Integration Tests
Located in `src/tests/integration/`
- Test component interactions
- Limited mocking
- Real database connections
- Coverage target: >80%

### End-to-End Tests
Located in `src/tests/e2e/`
- Full system tests
- Real external services
- API endpoints
- Coverage target: >70%

## Test Infrastructure

### Fixtures
- Database fixtures
- Redis fixtures
- Service fixtures
- Sample data fixtures

### Mocking Strategy
1. Database Mocking
   ```python
   @pytest.fixture
   def mock_db():
       mock = MagicMock()
       # Setup mock chain for fluent interface
       return mock
   ```

2. Redis Mocking
   ```python
   @pytest.fixture
   def mock_redis():
       mock = MagicMock()
       mock.get = AsyncMock()
       # Setup async operations
       return mock
   ```

### Async Testing
- Use `pytest.mark.asyncio`
- Proper async fixture handling
- Error handling in async context

## Best Practices

### Test Structure
1. Arrange
   - Setup test data
   - Configure mocks
   - Define expected outcomes

2. Act
   - Execute the function under test
   - Capture results

3. Assert
   - Verify results
   - Check mock interactions
   - Validate error handling

### Naming Conventions
- Test files: `test_*.py`
- Test functions: `test_*`
- Clear, descriptive names
- Include success/failure scenarios in name

### Documentation
- Test purpose in docstring
- Clear arrange/act/assert sections
- Document mock setup
- Log test results

## Coverage Requirements

### Minimum Coverage
- Unit Tests: 90%
- Integration Tests: 80%
- E2E Tests: 70%
- Overall: 85%

### Current Coverage
```
Name                      Stmts   Miss Branch   Miss   Cover
-------------------------------------------------------
src/core/cache.py           45      0      8      0   100%
src/services/message.py     52      0     12      0   100%
-------------------------------------------------------
TOTAL                      97      0     20      0   100%
```

## Test Results
- Logged in `logs/testing/`
- Date-stamped results
- Coverage reports
- Performance metrics

## Continuous Integration
- Run tests on every PR
- Block merges on test failures
- Coverage reports in PR comments
- Performance regression checks

## Next Steps
1. Implement remaining service tests
2. Add integration test suites
3. Setup E2E test infrastructure
4. Add performance testing
5. Improve test documentation
