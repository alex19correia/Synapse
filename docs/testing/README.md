# Synapse Testing Documentation ðŸ§ª

## Overview
This document outlines the testing strategy and implementation for the Synapse project. The testing suite is designed to ensure reliability, performance, and correctness of all system components.

## Test Structure
The testing suite is organized into several key areas:

### 1. Unit Tests
Located in `tests/` with component-specific subdirectories:
- `tests/api/`: API endpoint and middleware tests
- `tests/llm/`: LLM client and integration tests
- `tests/cache/`: Cache system tests
- `tests/crawler/`: Web crawler tests
- `tests/rag/`: RAG system tests

### 2. Integration Tests
Tests that verify component interactions:
- LLM system with DeepSeek API
- Cache system with Redis
- RAG system with document store
- API endpoints with middleware

### 3. End-to-End Tests
Located in `tests/e2e/`:
- Complete user flows
- System integration scenarios
- Error handling paths
- Performance requirements

### 4. Performance Tests
Located in `tests/performance/`:
- Latency measurements
- Concurrent load testing
- Memory usage monitoring
- System stability tests
- Cache performance
- Stress testing

## Test Requirements

### API System
- âœ… Route handlers
- âœ… Middleware functions
- âœ… Authentication
- âœ… Rate limiting
- âœ… Error handling
- âœ… Request validation

### LLM System
- âœ… Basic chat completion
- âœ… Streaming responses
- âœ… Error recovery
- âœ… Rate limit handling
- âœ… Context management
- âœ… Model parameters

### Cache System
- âœ… Basic operations (set/get)
- âœ… TTL management
- âœ… Complex data handling
- âœ… Concurrent operations
- âœ… Error handling
- âœ… Metrics collection

### RAG System
- âœ… Document indexing
- âœ… Similarity search
- âœ… Context retrieval
- âœ… Embedding generation
- âœ… Cache integration
- âœ… Error handling

### Crawler System
- âœ… Page fetching
- âœ… Rate limiting
- âœ… HTML parsing
- âœ… Metadata extraction
- âœ… Robots.txt compliance
- âœ… Content filtering

## Performance Requirements

### Latency
- Average response time: < 1.0s
- 95th percentile: < 2.0s
- 99th percentile: < 3.0s

### Throughput
- Minimum: concurrency / 5 requests per second
- Scales with concurrency levels: 5, 10, 20

### Memory
- Maximum increase under load: < 100MB
- Stable memory usage pattern

### Reliability
- Success rate: > 95% under stress
- Timeouts: < 5 per 100 requests
- Long-term reliability: > 99%

### Cache Performance
- Average hit latency: < 0.1s
- Hit rate monitoring
- Memory usage tracking

## Running Tests

### Setup
```bash
# Install test dependencies
pip install pytest pytest-asyncio pytest-cov

# Set up test environment
export PYTHONPATH=src/
export TEST_ENV=true
```

### Running Test Suites
```bash
# Run all tests
pytest

# Run specific test categories
pytest tests/api/  # API tests
pytest tests/llm/  # LLM tests
pytest tests/cache/  # Cache tests
pytest tests/crawler/  # Crawler tests
pytest tests/e2e/  # E2E tests
pytest tests/performance/  # Performance tests

# Run with coverage
pytest --cov=src/ tests/
```

### Test Markers
- `@pytest.mark.asyncio`: Async tests
- `@pytest.mark.integration`: Integration tests
- `@pytest.mark.e2e`: End-to-end tests
- `@pytest.mark.performance`: Performance tests

## Continuous Integration
Tests are automatically run on:
- Pull requests
- Main branch commits
- Release tags

### CI Pipeline
1. Setup test environment
2. Run unit tests
3. Run integration tests
4. Run E2E tests
5. Run performance tests
6. Generate coverage report
7. Validate performance metrics

## Known Issues and TODOs
1. Add more concurrent load testing scenarios
2. Implement chaos testing for resilience
3. Add more edge cases for error handling
4. Expand performance test coverage
5. Add memory leak detection tests
6. Implement API contract tests
7. Add more RAG system integration tests
8. Improve crawler test coverage
9. Add long-term stability tests
