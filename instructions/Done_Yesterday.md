Based on the documentation and current state of the system, I see several key areas we could focus on:
1. Metrics & Monitoring Improvements:
We have basic metrics collection working, but we should enhance our monitoring by:
Setting up proper alerting rules (we disabled them earlier)
Creating comprehensive Grafana dashboards for system health
Adding more detailed metrics for the RAG system performance
2. API Performance & Reliability:
The API metrics endpoint is working, suggesting we have basic instrumentation
We should focus on:
Implementing proper error handling and logging
Adding request tracing
Setting up performance benchmarks
3. Vector Database Optimization:
Qdrant is running but marked as starting
We should:
Configure proper collection settings
Implement vector indexing optimization
Set up backup strategies
4.  Caching Strategy:
Redis is running with basic configuration
We could:
Implement proper caching policies
Set up cache invalidation strategies
Configure memory limits and eviction policies
5. Documentation & Testing:
Add comprehensive API documentation
Implement integration tests
Set up CI/CD pipelines
