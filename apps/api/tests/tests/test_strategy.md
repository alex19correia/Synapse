# Synapse Testing Strategy

## Overview
This document outlines the testing strategy for the Synapse project, detailing our approach to ensuring code quality, reliability, and maintainability through comprehensive testing.

## Testing Levels

### Unit Tests
- Location: `src/tests/unit/`
- Purpose: Test individual components in isolation
- Tools: pytest, unittest.mock
- Coverage Target: 100%
- Key Areas:
  - Core Services (Message, Cache, Crawler, LLM)
  - Configuration Management
  - Data Models
  - Utility Functions

### Integration Tests
- Location: `src/tests/integration/`
- Purpose: Test component interactions
- Tools: pytest, httpx, aioredis
- Coverage Target: 90%
- Key Areas:
  - API Endpoints
  - Database Operations
  - External Service Integration
  - Message Flow

### End-to-End Tests
- Location: `src/tests/e2e/`
- Purpose: Test complete user scenarios
- Tools: pytest, playwright
- Coverage Target: 80%
- Key Areas:
  - User Workflows
  - System Integration
  - Performance Scenarios
  - Error Recovery

## Testing Practices

### Test Organization
1. Group tests by component/feature
2. Use descriptive test names
3. Follow AAA pattern (Arrange, Act, Assert)
4. Include docstrings explaining test purpose

### Mocking Strategy
1. Use unittest.mock for external dependencies
2. Create reusable fixtures
3. Mock at the lowest level possible
4. Document mock behavior

### Continuous Integration
1. Run tests on every PR
2. Enforce coverage requirements
3. Automate test reporting
4. Track test metrics

## Test Categories

### Functional Tests
- Feature Verification
- Error Handling
- Edge Cases
- Boundary Testing

### Non-Functional Tests
- Performance Testing
- Load Testing
- Security Testing
- Usability Testing

### Data Tests
- Data Validation
- State Management
- Data Flow
- Persistence

## Tools and Frameworks

### Primary Tools
- pytest: Test runner and framework
- coverage.py: Code coverage
- unittest.mock: Mocking
- pytest-asyncio: Async testing

### Supporting Tools
- pytest-cov: Coverage reporting
- pytest-xdist: Parallel testing
- pytest-benchmark: Performance testing
- pytest-timeout: Test timeouts

## Best Practices

### Code Quality
1. Keep tests simple and focused
2. Use meaningful assertions
3. Avoid test interdependence
4. Maintain test code quality

### Documentation
1. Document test setup
2. Explain complex scenarios
3. Include examples
4. Update test documentation

### Maintenance
1. Regular test review
2. Remove obsolete tests
3. Update test data
4. Monitor test performance

## Metrics and Reporting

### Key Metrics
- Test Coverage
- Test Duration
- Pass/Fail Rate
- Code Quality

### Reporting
1. Generate coverage reports
2. Track trends
3. Document failures
4. Share insights
